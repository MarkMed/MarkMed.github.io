## The concept and the Game Experience
### 1. Recently played game:
> Monster Hunter World
>
> Very exciting. You are drop in a huge map, explore, looking for clues to locate your monster target. When you are facing to the located monster, you should be very alert and evading or blocking its attacks.
> It's a very exciting experience. An awe, discovering, fighting, and relaxing experience.
---
### 2. Thinking in experience, and making!
> I think in a frantic experience. A full frenzy experience, an experience of speed, of risk, of emotion and surprise, and a futuristic experience. An experience of mental speed and competitive combats.
>
> A game that transmits that experience should have strange weapons, great and curious game physics, very quick movements, curious and well design characters, fast and techy music, great and confusing but intuitive maps, vehicles driving, space and technology stuff, and so on.
> A game that approach to have that experience is Unreal Tournament 99 (Modded).
