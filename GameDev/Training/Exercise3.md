## 1 - Games Mechanics

### Unreal Tournament 99:

* #### Game Genre and main Mechanics:

> Genre: First Person Shooter
>
> Main Mechanics:
>
> * Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)
> * Exploration (map recognition (traps, shortcuts))
> * Weapons and items knowledge

* #### Selected mechanic and its adaptation with the rest of them:

> Selected mechanic: Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)
> 
> In this game, the _Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic must be accompanied with the _Exploration (map recognition (traps and shortcuts))_ mechanic and _Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic to have advantage over your opponents.
> You can be the best dominating the _Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic, you can have the best accuracy shoot, run fast, and evade better than others players, but someone with great handling of _Exploration (map recognition (traps and shortcuts))_ mechanic and _Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic will beat you. 
>
> To be a great player in this game, you must have a good understand in the game dynamic. Mastering these main mechanics: Be a great shooter (_Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic), know and understand the map (_Exploration (map recognition (traps and shortcuts))_ mechanic), and understand and know how to use the weapons and items of the map (_Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic).
> And you must know all this because it cannot be splitted. Each mechanic must be together with the other.
>
> For example, you know that there is the "super-weapon" on a specific high place but it is unable to access without an extra-impulse (_Exploration (map recognition (traps and shortcuts))_ mechanic and _Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic). And for that you will need the "Jump Boots" item located in a specific place of the map!
> But when you were going to take them, another player killed you because it has a stronger weapon (_Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic) and took the "Jump Boots" item. Then, when you respawn, you have next to you the "RocketLauncher" weapon, and in that moment you remember that "RocketLauncher" weapon have an strong recoil and you can use it in middle of a jump to acces to the high place where the "super-weapon" is located! (_Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic)
> While you go to that place, you kill other players by shooting them to the ground where they are standing (_Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic). And in that way I reach the place to jump and shoot the ground to make a "super-jump" (_Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic) and you manage to take the "super-weapon" that kills every player close in a certain range of "super-weapon" detonation (_Shooter (run, evade, and shoot)_ mechanic and _Weapons and items knowledge_ mechanic).

* #### Do you consider that this game has a good mechanics design?

> Yes! It's a perfect combination. It's an extra in FPS games that is just shoot to the enemy. Know the map, evade, run, know each weapon mechanic, predict enemies/opponents movements, strange maps desing... And all that in a frantic combat. I donÂ´t know what else can be added...
