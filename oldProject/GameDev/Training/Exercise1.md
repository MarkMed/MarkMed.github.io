# Exercise 1
## 1 - Introduction to VideoGame Development Process
### 1. My own concept of _VideoGame_ :

> Is a computer program that contains dynamics or challenges for user entertainment through constant interaction with said program.
---

### 2. Justification:

+ The concept of _Computer Program_ has been included into the _My own concept of VideoGame_ because a Videogame is exctly that, a computer program. A secuence of processes with a final purpose. In this case, this computer program awaits for the user interactions.

+ In the previous explanation also is detailed why the concept of _Interaction_ is included in _My own concept of VideoGame_. The user choose the program (game) flow and it executes its processes. As example: Create a new game, load a saved game, take an item during a battle, etc.

+ _Dynamics or challenges_ are concept included in _My own concept of VideoGame_ because in every game must be a sense for the user to interact. It can be simple actions or goals to be achieved or to be completed.

### 3. Game genre:

> RPG
---

### 4. My player-type:

>  In the game u can be everything (_killer_, _explorer_, _achiever_ and _socializer_), but I am mainly _killer_ and _explorer_ because I like to go around the area, collect items, look for monsters, and find my target monster. Also I like to defend my self from hostiles monsters and hunt my target monster to complete the quest.
> I don't care about complete goals, I just like to play the main purposes of the game: Hunt, defend, and explore.
> 
>  There is posibilities to be a _achiever_ or _socializer_ player too, but, I generally like to play alone because I like to decide when the quest ends.
